# Assignment 3

This repository contains my Assignment 3 for the course SOFTENG 281: Object-Oriented Programming in Semester 1 2023. All code within 'datastructures' folder was created or implemented by me.

In this project we learnt to:
- Represent graphs using object-oriented concepts and program methods to test for reflexivity, symmetry, transitivity, antisymmetry and equivalence
- Implement common data structures (stack and queue) and understand their time complexity.
- Understand and implement both iterative and recursive implementations of Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Depth-First Search (DFS).
- Write clear and concise Javadoc documentation

This assignment earned 100% for functionality.
